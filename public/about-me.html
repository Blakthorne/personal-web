                    My programming journey began in computer science class during high school&mdash;it introduced various concepts like iteration, boolean algrebra, and object-oriented programming through Java. This class challenged me to think differently and become a better problem-solver, which spurred me to further pursue the field and enroll as a computer science major at

                    During my studies, I delved deeper into what I had only skimmed over in high school and discovered new technologies that solved old and new problems. I experienced both the thrilling and challenging aspects of computer science from desktop application development to algorithm analysis to compiler design. And WOW! Some of those classes were <b>really</b> hard&mdash;but they always turned out to be the most rewarding. Turning your teacher into Emperor Palpatine for a 2D platformer turns out to be quite fun!

                    Graduation marked the end of my formal studies in May of 2022, where I graduated Cum Laude with my computer science and music degrees.

                    My parents nursed in me a love for music when I was young&mdash;my mom began teaching me piano at age five, and I started playing trombone in school at age ten. Growing up in church, I was also surrounded by the singing and music-making of those always around me. Looking back, I clearly see the prominence of music in my formative years. The love my parents have for music continues in me.

                    Many musical outlets were presented to me during my middle and high school years by both my school and my community, such as all-county bands, pit bands for musicals, and a wonderful

                    These opportunities, along with my teachers and friends, always stretched me to not only play music well, but to communicate through my music. And of course, besting my friends in seating auditions was always a strong motivator!

                    I eventually went off to study music alongside computer science in college, where I quickly realized I had so much more left to learn. For my first audition there, I placed last chair in the trombone section of their

                    even qualifying for the orchestra. However, within two years of weekly lessons and many, <b>many</b> hours of practice, I was principal of the Wind Symphony and Symphony Orchestra! My teachers helped me to mature into a versatile musician while I learned everything I could about music performance, theory, history, and technologies. Besides my schooling, I also spent a semester interning with a

                    For as long as I can remember, I have cherished my time spent reading. Memories of summer days during my elementary years on a couch reading books like

                    hold a special place in my heart. And the joy I found reading tales of fantasy and mystery as a child cultivated in me a love for words and stories and scholarship. I remain fascinated by the stories people have to tell, and the scope of things that I enjoy only broadens with each passing year. Thus, deliberately seeking out history, philosophy, and theology makes me feel a little more fit to decipher my world.

                    During my sophomore year in college, my roommate came to me with a splendid job opportunity&mdash;a book mending position at the school's
                        <a class="p-link" href="https://library.bju.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">library</a>&mdash;and
                    for the next three years I trained and proved myself as a skilled book mender. But this became much more than just another job to help pay for college, and not just because of the unlimited free coffee and tea! I soon regarded book mending as my time for peace, and I developed a cool fondness for my tools and the process. The nature of the job lends itself to time alone, so I started listening to podcasts to help pass the time. Since then, I have become enthralled with the story of my language&mdash;English&mdash;due to the tactful presentation of its narrative by
